## Network Storage

### EFS Architecture

EFS moves the instances closer to a stateless.

EFS is an implementation of NFSv4

EFS Filesystems can be mounted in Linux.

Using Amazon EFS with Microsoft Windowsâ€“based Amazon EC2 instances is not supported.

Media can be shared between many EC2 instances.

This is a private service, access is via mount targets inside a VPC.

You can access from on-premises with VPN or DX so long as access is configured.

#### Elastic File System Explained

EFS runs inside a VPC.
EFS includes POSIX permissions. These are made available via mount targets.

For a fully highly available system you need a mount target for each AZ the
system runs in.

You can use hybrid networking to connect to the same mount targets.

#### EFS Exam Powerup

EFS is Linux Only

Two performance modes, general purpose and max I/O performance mode.

General purpose = default for 99.9% of uses

Bursting and provisioned throughput modes.

Two storage classes available, standard and infrequent access.

Lifecycle policies can move data between EFS
